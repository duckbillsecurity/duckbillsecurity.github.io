    <h1>Welcome to Maldev Defend</h1>
    <p>
        Maldev Defend is a cybersecurity project designed to explore, understand the methods used by attackers to run malicious code on Windows systems and defend. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of various techniques employed by malicious actors to evade detection and successfully execute payloads.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our focus is on performing a deep dive into the Portable Executable (PE) format, employing benign shellcode to study different evasion methods, and testing detection mechanisms. The project will cover:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In-depth analysis of the PE file format.</li>
        <li>Exploration of evasion techniques such as process hollowing, thread injection, and hoax parent processes.</li>
        <li>Evaluation of detection efficacy using Windows Defender and Defender for Endpoint.</li>
        <li>Creation of detection rules for YARA and Sigma in a SIEM environment.</li>
        <li>Analysis using Ghidra, Process Hacker, and Wireshark.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Join us as we delve into the intricacies of malware analysis and develop robust strategies for detecting and defending against advanced threats.
